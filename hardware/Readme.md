Please wait. The hardware will be converted from EAGLE to KiCad<br/>
<b>Note:</b> I will post hardware which is not fully compatible with the official code of ESC32.
versions:<br/><br/>
HardWr_0.2 is on single-layer (w. bridges) routed PCB. ESC32 works on bluepill.
The CPU is STM32F103C8T6, found on cheap chinese boards called Bluepill.
Uses IR2110S Mosfet gate drivers.
