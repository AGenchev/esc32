# code taken from esc32, heavily reworked
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/esc32

I plan to modify this and reform the project... The goal - to compile with FOSS tools completely and to contain all source.
I will offer a PCB hardware design to test it.
The clone won't be called esc32, because I don't want to confuse the users - I will introduce new bugs.
